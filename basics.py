# We can also handle different bases in python
# - number such as (0o) for octal
# - number such as (0x) for hexadecimal
# - number such as (0b) for binary
# >>> 0o10    
# 8
# >>> 0x10
# 16
# >>> 0b10    
# 2

# >>> oct(100)
# '0o144'
# >>> hex(100)
# '0x64'
# >>> bin(100)
# '0b1100100'

# We can also calculate through integer function
# >>> int('100',2)
# 4
# >>> int('100',8)
# 64
# >>> int('100',16)
# 256

# We can also operate bitwise operations in python

# >>> x = 1
# >>> x << 2  # here we are shifting the bits to left by 2
# 4 ===> (0001 << 2 = 0100)We can also handle imaginary numbers in python
# >>> 2 + 1j
# (2+1j)
# >>> 2 + 1j * 3
# (2+3j)
# >>> (2 + 1j) * 3
# (6+3j)
